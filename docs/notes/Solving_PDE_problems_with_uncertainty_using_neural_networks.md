# Analysis about "Solving PDE problems with uncertainty using neural-networks"
This work was found as a reference inside "Fourier Neural Operator For Parametric Partial Differential Equations". It studies the possibility of using neural networks to parametrize a physical quantity of interest as a function of input coefficients. But this approach is mesh dependent.
